Welcome to CM.DOS!
This is the public beta for CM.DOS, the mini plugin-free batch OS.

=======================================================================================================================================================================================
Info on CM.DOS: 

It started out as a very small project, called CMDOS, which was a small batch file capable of opening a few computer programs. The code was later looked over and much improved,
to make the first alpha of CM.DOS. The purpose of this "mini operating system" is to show the capabilities of batch programming, which is looked down upon for being "easy, simple and
capable of nothing".
